# netflix-clone

Welcome to my Netflix clone project! In this project, I will be using the **free movie database API** provided by **The Movie DB** to build a frontend that allows users to **browse**, **search** and **save** movies and TV shows. I will also be implementing **authentication** and **authorization** for both **logged in**and **guest users**, as well as **a favorites system** that allows users to **save** their **preferred movies and TV shows** for easy access.

One of the features of this project will be a **debounced search**, which will help **improve the performance of our application** by **reducing the number of unnecessary API calls.** In addition to this, I will also be showcasing many other exciting features such as **responsive design, modern user interfaces, and seamless user experience**.

In addition to the features mentioned above, I will also be paying close attention to **SEO** and **site performance** throughout the development of this project. I will be using **Lighthouse** to ensure that our site is **optimized for search engines** and delivers a fast, seamless experience for users.

To help me focus on other areas of the project, I will be utilizing **Material-UI** for styling. **MUI** is a popular library of pre-designed React components that allows me to easily implement modern, responsive designs without spending too much time on custom styling.

Overall, my goal is to create a top-quality Netflix clone that not only looks great and offers a wide range of features, but also delivers a fast and seamless experience for users.
